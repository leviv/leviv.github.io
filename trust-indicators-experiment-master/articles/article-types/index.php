        <p>The News Beat publishes five different types of articles: news, analysis, opinion, reviews and advertiser content.</p>

        <h4>News</h4>
        <p>A news report is based on facts, either observed and verified by the author or verified from knowledgeable sources. This includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue, unlike public relations or propaganda. News reports do not incorporate the opinion of the author. </p>

        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>A news analysis is based on factual reporting and adheres to the general guidelines for news reports, although an analysis incorporates the expertise of the author and may offer interpretations and conclusions.</p>

        <h4>Opinion</h4>
        <p>An opinion piece advocates for ideas and draw conclusions based on the author’s interpretation of facts and data. Opinion pieces may include reported facts or quotes, but emphasize the author’s own thoughts, personal preferences and conclusions.</p>

        <h4>Review</h4>
        <p>A review assesses or critiques a service, product or creative endeavor such as art, literature or a performance.</p>

        <h4>Advertiser Content</h4>
        <p>Advertiser content may look somewhat like any of the above but is produced on behalf of, at the behest of, or by an individual or organization that has paid the news provider for its placement. It does not meet the standards of impartial journalism.</p>
