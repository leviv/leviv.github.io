$article = '<p>A Pentagon plan to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan aims to halt advances by Taliban insurgents in the short term, but the broader goal is to find a political path to end America’s longest war.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the Pentagon is formulating a new approach to the war, now in its 16th year. He said that a new strategy would consider whether to bring “more diplomatic and economic pressures on surrounding nations” to help end the conflict.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has called the fighting a stalemate between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Taliban. Gen. John Nicholson has commanded U.S. Forces Afghanistan and said a few thousand more U.S. troops would be required to turn the tide but would not alter the current military approach, which is to support Afghan forces.</p> 
<p>The Taliban, which represents an extreme version of Islam, is benefiting from a lack of popular support for the central government, which is widely viewed as inept, corrupt and a puppet of the United States. Recent Taliban gains are a dangerous sign, said Seth Jones, an analyst at RAND Corp. “If the Taliban can hold rural areas, it provides them with a sanctuary and eventually they can move on to urban areas,” he said.
The administration is trying to develop a broader strategy for the region. Insurgencies cannot be defeated on the battlefield alone, Jones said.</p>
