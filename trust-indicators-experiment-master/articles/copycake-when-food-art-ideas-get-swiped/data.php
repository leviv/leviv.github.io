$article = '<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; Where do you draw the line between inspiration and imitation when it comes to food?</p>
<p>A few years ago, we brought you the story of Caitlin Freeman, a pastry chef baking innovative, art-inspired cakes at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Using modern art as her muse, Freeman translated what she saw in the museum into edible form at the SFMOMA&rsquo;s upstairs café.'.footnote(1,$footnotes).'</p>
<p>Her creations eventually filled a cookbook, Modern Art Desserts, and her most well-known dish, a cake composed of small, primary-colored blocks delicately cemented together with chocolate icing, graced its cover. Inspired by the geometric art of Piet Mondrian, it brought both Freeman and the café fame – and inspired many a home cook to tackle this masterpiece at home.</p>
<p>The museum closed for renovations in 2013. When it re-opened last month, the upstairs café was under new management, with a new baking team – but the art-themed desserts for sale looked suspiciously familiar to Freeman. Call it a case of copycake.</p>
<p>Blue Bottle, the coffeehouse chain owned by Freeman&rsquo;s husband, James Freeman, used to run the SFMOMA&rsquo;s upstairs café, but it failed to win its bid to return after the renovations. Freeman was disappointed, but, as a lifelong art lover, she nonetheless felt compelled to take her infant daughter to check out the refurbished museum. She even stopped for a few moments to take in the scene at the new café, now run by a catering company that had previously operated the museum&rsquo;s downstairs café.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when three &ldquo;art-inspired&rdquo; desserts the café was serving caught her eye.</p><p>The dishes were strikingly similar in both spirit and design to desserts that Freeman and her team created several years ago for a museum event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stings because I felt like I was doing something for beauty and for love,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so bummed that the SFMOMA didn&rsquo;t want me and my future inspiration back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the museum says art as a muse for food is not a concept that belongs to Freeman. Neither the SFMOMA nor the new caterer responded to interview requests, but, in a statement, the museum said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SFMOMA is highly respectful of the expression of our partners and their desire to draw inspiration from the museum&rsquo;s architecture and art collection to create new work across all media, including food. Our art-inspired desserts continue a long tradition of art-inspired food served at SFMOMA and at museums and cultural institutions all over the world. We were pleased that Caitlin Freeman was a part of that legacy and are very grateful and respectful of her contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the art world as in the food world, creators are constantly finding inspiration in — and riffing off — each other&rsquo;s work.'.footnote(2,$footnotes).' But food is a difficult medium to copyright, so some chefs give credit on the menu if a dish was inspired by another chef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recipes are not copyrightable, nor are methods of cooking, and ideas are never copyrightable. So the idea of making desserts inspired by artworks could not be copyrighted,&rdquo; says intellectual property attorney Naomi Beckman-Straus with the firm Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, there is no clear reason why the visual appearance of a dish could not be copyrighted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Because our legal system works on precedent, a lot of it is just that it&rsquo;s generally accepted that there&rsquo;s no copyright protection for restaurant dishes or food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Freeman, she says she doesn&rsquo;t plan to pursue legal action.</p>
<p>Complicating all of this is the fact that Corey Lee, the three-Michelin-star chef, is opening a restaurant basically dedicated to cooking the dishes popular at other restaurants while citing them and giving them credit. Of that spot, which has yet to open, he says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;thinking of it as a food exhibition.&rdquo; Since Freeman hasn&rsquo;t gotten SFMOMA to budge, at least yet, maybe she ought to talk to Lee about getting her name on his dessert menu.</p>';

$why_wrote = '<p>Picasso is believed to have said, “good artists copy; great artists steal.” There is a long history of artists borrowing, copying, and yes, even stealing the ideas of other artists. Not only was this story an interesting twist on this notion, with edible art as the focus, but the blurring lines of intellectual property limits portends legal struggles that may have far-reaching implications across a variety of creative industries.</p>';
