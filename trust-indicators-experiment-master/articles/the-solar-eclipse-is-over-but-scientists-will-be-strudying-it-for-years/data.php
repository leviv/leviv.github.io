$article = '<p>The scientists who studied the eclipse will continue to pore over the data gathered and publish scientific studies for years.</p>
<p>During the eclipse, one of the most important observations was of the sun\'s corona, the sun\'s thin, outer atmosphere that is only visible during total eclipses. The corona is so dim that it is usually totally overwhelmed by the light from the sun, Space.com said, but during the total solar eclipse, that light was conveniently blocked. That allowed astronomers to study the shape, structure and extent of the sun\'s corona.</p>
    <p>In addition, NASA\'s Eclipse Ballooning Project Students conducted high-altitude balloon flights from 30 locations across the total eclipse path, sending live video and images from near space to NASA about the Earth\'s weather and other information.</p>
    <p>Scientists at zoos and aquariums across the country closely watched animal behavior during the eclipse, which will be studied in the months ahead. At the Memphis Zoo, for instance, though not in the path of totality, animals such as elephants, hippos, crocodiles and penguins exhibited unusual behavior.</p>
        <p>Each year, as Earth slows in its rotation, the moon edges an inch and a half farther away. In six hundred million years, it will be distant enough that it will no longer fully occlude the sun. There will be eclipses nonetheless, though not as glorious as the one we just witnessed.</p>
        <p>“We saw some subtle changes to Asali’s behavior,” said Amanda Schweighart, the elephant manager, referring to an elephant at the zoo. “She’s the youngest of our herd, and she went into an \'alert\' stance, that lasted several seconds. Once she reunited herself with her two herd mates, her behavior returned to normal.” Young giraffes at the Nashville zoo were also spotted running in circles during the eclipse.</p>

However, these drugs have been used so widely and for so long that the infectious organisms the antibiotics are designed to kill have adapted to them, making the drugs less effective. This article was written to highlight this growing danger, raise a warning voice, and showcase the efforts of those working on the frontlines of antibiotic resistance.</p>';
