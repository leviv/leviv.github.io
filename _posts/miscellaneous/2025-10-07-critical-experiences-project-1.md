1. What is your guide?

   My guide is a diorama/showcase to show the longevity of different forms of preservation. I'm going to create different physical representations of a digital Neopet and mount them on a backing that looks like a real taxidermy mount

2. What are you titling your guide?

   "Digital Taxidermy"

3. Who is your guide for? 

   Anyone who has been locked out of a childhood web account. Anyone who has previously had a digital pet on sites like Neopets, Club Penguin, Webkinz, etc.

4. Why did you choose this form for your guide? 

   I thought the idea of seeing a neopet head mounted on a wall sounded really funny.

5. What are the affordances of your guide? 

   - Approachable: anyone can walk up and see it
   - Visual/Educational: each mount will be labeled with the number of years it could theoretically be preserved for

6. What does your guide enable for your audience?

   See the above questions

7. How do you know if this guide is successful? 

   If it inspires reminisce, laughter, or learning in the audience, it will be a success for me.

8. What are two questions you have about your guide, as it currently stands? 

   - How big should I make the plaques? What should I make them out of?
   - What are all the different mediums I want to explore? So far I'm thinking of a flash drive, paper, plastic, and clay/stone

9. Would you add/edit anything to the Critique Guidelines from the Summer Session? If not, why? 

   I remember in the readings we did for critique, there was a quote that said something to the effect of, "The person getting to most out of a critique is the one talking." That has really stuck with me and really helped me leave space for other people to speak even when critiquing their work.
