# Levi Villarreal - Kleiner Perkins Fellow Response

These responses are for the 2021 [Kleiner Perkins Fellowship](https://fellows.kleinerperkins.com/) application!

### What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

During quarantine over the past few months, I have had an uncomfortable amount of time for self-reflection on this very question. Throughout my internships, I have heavily prioritized experiences that I thought would allow me to learn and grow the most. However, as I approach graduation, I have been thinking about how I want to use these experiences.

I want to make something that will be used and enjoyed by many people from various walks of life. Making things gives me a lot of satisfaction, and I get even more satisfaction when I know that something that I made matters to other people, and helps them. I have experienced this on a small scale while in college, creating small, specific tools used by friends and classmates, but I want to do that on a much larger scale. For example, Robinhood is an app that is used by millions of people and has provided access to a resource that would otherwise be hidden from its users. The scale of that kind of impact is rarely seen outside of technology and was what drove me to software engineering in the first place.

### Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.

One thing I don't mention to many people is that in the months leading up to my freshman year at college, I worked at a steel manufacturing plant, and as a construction laborer to save money so that I could attend. I spent 8-10 hours every day either in an unconditioned warehouse or at an unfinished commercial building site in the middle of the Texas summer, cutting steel, carrying heavy beams, and cleaning. Every night I would come home exhausted and anxiously count down the days when I would finally be able to quit my job and attend college. However, working in those positions taught me that I could do hard things, and gave me lots of time to think about what kind of work I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 

After that summer, I have spent my subsequent summers working as an intern at Adobe, Google, and Two Sigma, a fact that still seems somewhat surreal to me. Almost every day that summer, I used to come home from work, covered in sweat and grime and build websites and write programs as a way of destressing and having fun. And even though software engineering has its own set of (non-physical) challenges, the fact that I now get to do that every day has yet to get old.
