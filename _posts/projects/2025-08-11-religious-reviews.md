In 2024 I attended meetings of 10 churches of different denominations. Below are my reviews.

This is a remix of my [blog post from last week](https://leviv.cool/miscellaneous/2025/08/04/i-went-to-10-churches-in-1-year,-what-i-learned-will-shock-you.html). I was heavily inspired by *The Anthroposcene Reviewed* by John Green. I have a long, winding relationship with religion and the idea of boiling it down to a simple five star Yelp review made me laugh.

This is my final assignment for my [Exploratory Making](https://www.exploratorymaking.art/) class at IMA Low-Res. Over this semester I have learned that I feedback throughout the design process actually does push me in good ways. I often get really caught up in my own vision and ignore the advice of others while I'm in the middle of making a project. While I think this tendency has helped me focus on what I find important, it can also prevent my work from reaching it's full potential. Being surrounded by thoughtful people who want to engage in my work in meaningful ways has made a big difference.
