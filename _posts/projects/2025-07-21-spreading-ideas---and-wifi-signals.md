This was the first project for my [Exploratory Making](https://www.exploratorymaking.art) class.

As I mentioned [in a previous blog post](https://leviv.cool/ima/2025/07/11/giving-and-taking.html), we were expected to prepare a gift on the first day of this class. Something we were interested in and felt uniquely connected to. I brought a version of my pocket wifi portal - a device [Iâ€™ve blogged about in the past](https://leviv.cool/projects/2024/10/05/creating-a-pocket-wifi-portal.html) that creates for a localized, personalized wireless network of my choosing.

What she returned was a hand crafted collage of photos, of my chip, her friends checking out the webiste, and her surroundings when she showed it to them. I thought it was so cool how she took my digital gift and transformed it into something phyiscal - somthing that is more traditionally considered 'art'.

## Physical posters

Reflecting on my partners gift - I decided I wanted to build something physical. Originally I wanted to do something like oil paints, silkscreen etc - a very physical medium and something I had never touched before. However, time bounded forward and my days were pulled in multiple directions: work, other classes, sleep (sometimes). I found myself the weekend before this project was due with no progress made! Instead I turned to a medium slightly more familiar to me - graphic design!

Back in high school I used to use software to make memes, club flyers etc. But besides once for senior year science fair, I had never made a poster. And the design lab was just the place to start!

To begin, I rounded up the supplies I needed. Luckily I already had a supply of extra wifi chips on hand. And I also had a stack of 3 poster frames that I bought nearly a year ago, too small to fit the posters that I had bought them for. 

I started by using Affiinity Illustrator (I hate Adobes predatory pricing model) to whip up designs for the three articles showcased on my pocket wifi website.

I started easy - The first poster was using a graphic that came with the article. I screenshotted it, cropped it and added some text and a sattelite dish to the car. This helped re-introduce me to the software, and get back in the grove of things. The second poster was a little more ambitious, adding in a stylized wifi logo and a license free photo of a chicken on a sea of Vox yellow. and the final one was similarly simple, a silhouette of a soldier standing in front of a Palestinian tricolor flame. 

Even though these were all relatively simple posters, I tried to care a lot about positioning, fonts, and iconography. This was mainly due to my constraints in terms of drawing and experience with graphic design. 

After deisigning, it was off to the printers!



## Reflections

Overall - I was very satisfied with how this project turned out! The prints were by far the highest quality I've produced, and I think the simplicity added to their pognancy. If I had more time, I would have liked to explore a more fine art approach. Something more physical would have stuck to my theme even better - although I fear my lack of artistic experience would have shown through even more than it did here.
