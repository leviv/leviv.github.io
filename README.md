# leviv.github.io

A repository to hold all of my current projects. Currently all of the content on the site is static, although I plan to change that soon so that content can be updated more easily.

## Prerequisites

In order to compile the styles for this project, you need to have Jekyll installed.

```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
```

## Getting started

To clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leviv/leviv.github.io.git
```

Then run the app with the following commands

```bash
cd leviv.github.io
jekyll serve
```

and open http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Development

Edit any of the theme files and the page should automatically be built and reloaded
